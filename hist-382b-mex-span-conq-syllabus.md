# HIST382A/MDVL380C/LACS380S Mexico: Spanish Conquest

General Education: C - Composition, N - Social Science, I - Information Literacy, T - Critical Thinking

Fall 2025 – Tuesdays and Thursdays 3:15 pm - 4:45 pm (FA 342)

Instructor: Brad Skopyk, PhD, Associate Professor, bskopyk@binghamton.edu, LT 713, 607-777-4210

Office Hours: Tuesday 9:00 - 10:30 am & Wednesday 10:00 am - 11:30 am

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course explores the Spanish Conquest of Mexico by means of original sixteenth-century texts, images, and maps. Key themes are war, mass mortality, race, and religion, as well as the mixing of New and Old World literary genres and ways of writing/painting. As traditionally told, the conquest is the story of the defeat of alien and exotic empires by small bands of Spanish soldiers led by charismatic figures such as Hernán Cortés. For generations, the history of conquest was told as a story that reflected the European self-image as world conquerors, where the superiority of European technology and culture over indigenous American cultures was taken as given and the conquest as inevitable. New sources and new interpretive frameworks have led scholars to problematize heroic conquest accounts, myths of white Gods and the purported success of anti-idolatry campaigns. To what degree, we ask, have advances in reading the Conquest through indigenous eyes eroded the notion of a Spanish conquest itself?

This course is a 4-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled meeting times, students are expected to do at least 9.5 hours of course-related work outside of class each week during the semester. This includes time spent completing assigned readings, preparing for in-class writing assignments and labs, conducting research for written assignments, and other course-related tasks.

## ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS

### One-on-One Meetings with Instructor (Required, not graded)

You will attend two 20-minute one-on-one meetings with the instructor to discuss your term paper progress. These meetings are required but not graded. The meetings will be scheduled outside of class time during regular office hours or at another time during the week that fits the schedules of both students and the instructor. Meetings can be held in-person or via Zoom based on mutual preference and availability.

**Meeting Schedule:**
- First one-on-one meeting: October 21
- Second one-on-one meeting: December 2

The meetings provide an opportunity to discuss your research direction, address questions about your primary document analysis, and receive personalized feedback on your work.

### Required Readings (Not graded)

Readings are required and must be completed by class time on the day shown in the course schedule. For required readings, students must access resources from the Library's webpage or, when the resource is available only in print, on the course Brightspace page. GitHub will only be used for resources connected to labs; when labs rely on resources, a direct link to those GitHub resources will be provided.

For essays and term paper assignments, students should either ensure that their research notes are sufficient to write the essays or should bring print copies of the works they want to use. These will be left with the instructor at the end of the assignment and returned ASAP.

Students might wish to purchase Stuart Schwartz's Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views of the Conquest of Mexico, which is used extensively throughout the course and is only available in the library as a physical print resource.

### In-Class Labs (25% total)

You will complete 6 in-class labs with the lowest score dropped (5 of 6 count toward final grade). Each lab is worth 5% and will involve hands-on engagement with primary sources, historical analysis exercises, or research skill development. Labs will build from concepts introduced in previous meetings of regular class time. In many cases, labs can only be successfully completed if students have read secondary and/or primary sources cited by the lab question(s). Labs are completed using Respondus LockDown Browser during the 90-minute class period and cannot be made up if missed.

**Lab Schedule:**

- Lab 1: September 11 -- Cortés's Letters
- Lab 2: September 30 -- The Florentine Codex
- Lab 3: October 16 -- The Return of Quetzalcoatl
- Lab 4: October 23 -- Bartolomé de las Casas
- Lab 5: November 11 -- Historiography
- Lab 6: November 20 -- The Problem Statement, Thesis and Argument

### In-Class Interpretive Essays (20% total)

Students will write two in-class essays, each worth 10% of your final grade. You will have 90 minutes of class time to write each essay. Essays will be completed in our classroom during class time using Respondus LockDown Browser.

**Essay Due Dates:**

- First interpretive essay: October 7
- Second interpretive essay: December 2

The essay questions will be made available to students several days before the in-class essay and will ask you to think broadly and critically about a defined collection of readings that you have already completed. You may bring printed or handwritten notes to assist with composition. Notes must be on paper and, if multiple sheets are used, must be stapled together or compiled in a notebook or binder. Only point-form notes, outlines, citations, and similar textual items are permitted; notes written in prose are NOT allowed. All notes will be collected by the instructor at the completion of the assignment.

### Historiography Paper (10% total)

This assignment asks you to write a focused historiographical analysis related to your term paper topic. In 90 minutes of supervised class time, you will compose a paper that surveys and analyzes how historians have interpreted a specific aspect of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico that relates to your chosen primary document.

**Due Date: October 28**

The historiography paper should demonstrate your understanding of how historical scholarship has evolved over time, identify key debates and interpretive frameworks among historians, and position your own research within these scholarly conversations. You will conduct research and prepare your analysis outside of class, but the actual writing will occur during the designated class period using Respondus LockDown Browser.

You may bring printed or handwritten notes to assist with composition. Notes must be on paper and, if multiple sheets are used, must be stapled together or compiled in a notebook or binder. Only point-form notes, outlines, citations, and similar textual items are permitted; notes written in prose are NOT allowed. All notes will be collected by the instructor at the completion of the assignment.

You are also allowed to bring print copies (photocopies or published print materials) of any primary and secondary sources used in your research. These materials will be turned in at the end of the assignment and returned to the student ASAP.


### Primary Document Analysis (25% total: 5% first submission + 20% final submission)

In 90 minutes of supervised class time, you will write an analysis of a primary document from the Spanish Conquest period. This assignment calls for sustained analysis of your chosen primary source, demonstrating how this document can illuminate broader historical questions about the conquest.

- **First Submission Due Date: November 13 (5% - completion grade)**
- **Final Submission Due Date: December 4 (20% - quality grade)**

**First Submission (5%)**: The first submission will be graded on completion and demonstration of good understanding of the source and its complexities. Full marks (5%) will be awarded if the student writes the assignment and shows comprehension of the primary document's content, context, and historical significance.

**Final Submission (20%)**: After the first submission (completed in class using Respondus LockDown Browser), the instructor will transfer your original submission to a Google Doc, provide written feedback, and share the document with you. You are required to revise your paper directly in the same Google Doc. When your revision is complete, you must upload the revised Google Doc to the appropriate submission module in Brightspace by **December 4**. This final submission will be graded on the quality of historical analysis, argument development, use of evidence, and incorporation of instructor feedback.

Your analysis should introduce and contextualize the primary source, analyze its content and significance, and build an argument about what this source reveals about the conquest period. All research and preparation will be conducted outside of class, but the composition will occur during the designated class session using Respondus LockDown Browser. The revision should demonstrate thoughtful engagement with the instructor's feedback and show clear improvement in argumentation, analysis, and clarity. Note: The revision process and final submission for this assignment are completed in Google Docs and Brightspace, not in Respondus LockDown Browser.

You may bring printed or handwritten notes to assist with composition. Notes must be on paper and, if multiple sheets are used, must be stapled together or compiled in a notebook or binder. Only point-form notes, outlines, citations, and similar textual items are permitted; notes written in prose are NOT allowed. All notes will be collected by the instructor at the completion of the assignment.

You are also allowed to bring print copies (photocopies or published print materials) of any primary and secondary sources used in your research. These materials will be turned in at the end of the assignment and returned to the student ASAP.

### Final Interpretive Essay (20% total)

During the three-hour final exam period, you will write a comprehensive interpretive essay that formulates and defends a historical argument about some aspect of the Spanish Conquest substantiated by the primary and secondary documents consulted during your semester-long research. This essay should demonstrate your ability to define a historical problem, to use primary sources effectively, to formulate and defend a thesis, and to engage with historical debate and uncertainty.

**Due Date: During finals week (December 8-12)**

The final essay represents the culmination of your term paper research and should present a sophisticated historical argument supported by evidence from your primary document analysis and broader course materials. All preparation and research will be conducted throughout the semester, with the writing completed during the final exam session using Respondus LockDown Browser.

You may bring printed or handwritten notes to assist with composition. Notes must be on paper and, if multiple sheets are used, must be stapled together or compiled in a notebook or binder. Only point-form notes, outlines, citations, and similar textual items are permitted; notes written in prose are NOT allowed. All notes will be collected by the instructor at the completion of the assignment.

You are also allowed to bring print copies (photocopies or published print materials) of any primary and secondary sources used in your research. These materials will be turned in at the end of the assignment and returned to the student ASAP.

## ACADEMIC HONESTY

Don't cheat, plagiarize, use AI to compose, have somebody else do your work for you, or turn in work from another course. If you are caught, you will automatically fail the course, in addition to any university-mandated penalties for plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Get familiar with [Binghamton's Student Academic Honesty Code](https://www.binghamton.edu/bulletin/2023-24/policiesprocedures/index.html#p002), which are the rules that we follow. If you are confused about what might constitute academic dishonesty or plagiarism, please see your instructor.

### Further Notes on Academic Honesty

1. Professors use the internet all the time – if you found it, we can, too.
2. Cheating is bad citizenship. If you're a Democrat, it destroys the level playing field; if you're a Republican, it distorts free and open competition amongst individuals. (And if you're a libertarian or an anarchist, why are you attending a state school?)
3. Don't plagiarize – either directly, or by neglecting to cite ideas and arguments. Changing a few words or a verb tense, or rearranging a sentence, does not count as "putting something in your own words," even if you've added a citation.
4. Don't pay others to do your assignments for you – it's often more obvious than you think, especially for a paper due at the end of the semester, when we have become somewhat familiar with your writing style and general work habits. Or you might not get your money's worth and end up with a D.
5. Don't turn in work from another course. If you find complementary themes or materials in your other classes that you wish to make use of, clear it with me first.
6. Students in this course are not permitted to submit any work that uses text generated from artificial intelligence.

Ask for help when you need it.

## ADAPTATIONS AND ACCOMMODATIONS

If you have a disability that may require an accommodation for taking this course, please contact Services for Students with Disabilities (607.777.2686). Students who need accommodation should present an SSD authorization letter and contact me to discuss their specific needs. All discussions will remain confidential. Accommodations cannot be made retroactively.

**Extended Time Accommodations**: Students with approved extended time accommodations will complete all written assignments (labs, in-class interpretive essays, historiography paper, primary document analysis, and final interpretive essay) at the University Testing Center. These students should coordinate with both the instructor and the Testing Center to schedule their writing sessions. The same Respondus LockDown Browser requirements apply for all testing center sessions.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

The History Department has determined that students in history classes will:

1. Learn to read primary and secondary sources with a critical eye and express these ideas in effective papers; to analyze a variety of different types of written texts (or in some cases material evidence or oral accounts) and identify how each of them is shaped by author, audience, and the context in which they were constructed.
2. Develop the ability to communicate effectively in writing in a manner that is coherent, well-developed, and expressive of complex thought.
3. Improve the ability to think critically and to argue effectively.
4. Learn about the interactions between different groups within a single society and how these relationships have affected the development of respective regions, ethnicities or identities.
5. Improve the ability to recognize and develop connections between historical issues and life outside the classroom.
6. Enhance the ability to examine current issues from a historical perspective.

## COMPOSITION AND SUBMISSION PROCEDURES

All written composition (in-class essays, historiography paper, primary document analysis, and final interpretive essay) will be completed during class time or the scheduled final exam period. Research and planning for these assignments should be carried out outside of class time, but the actual writing will occur in a supervised classroom environment.

**Submission Policy:**
- All written assignments will be submitted using **Respondus LockDown Browser**, a secure browser application that prevents access to other websites, applications, or resources during the writing process. This ensures academic integrity and creates a fair testing environment for all students.
- **Exception:** The revision of the Primary Document Analysis will be completed in Google Docs (with instructor feedback) and the final revised document will be uploaded to the appropriate Brightspace assignment module, not through Respondus LockDown Browser.

**Grading Policy for Respondus LockDown Browser Assignments**: Assignments submitted through Respondus LockDown Browser will not be assessed based upon the eloquence, grammar, or spelling of written text, provided that the written text can be understood. Assessment will focus on content, historical analysis, argument development, and use of evidence.

### Course Materials Access

Students will have access to the course GitHub repository throughout the semester, which contains detailed assignment descriptions and PDF versions of all course readings. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for assignment preparation and research.

**Course GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/bds134/hist-382b-mex-span-conquest-2025-fall](https://github.com/bds134/hist-382b-mex-span-conquest-2025-fall)

### Notes Policy for Written Assignments

Students may bring printed or handwritten notes to assist with all written assignments. Notes must be on paper and, if multiple sheets are used, must be stapled together or compiled in a notebook or binder. Only point-form notes, outlines, citations, and similar textual items are permitted; **notes written in prose are NOT allowed**. All notes will be collected by the instructor at the completion of each assignment.

Regular class meetings will explain and demonstrate key concepts and ideas that will allow students to succeed in labs and essays. While marks are not given specifically for attendance or participation, regular attendance is essential for academic success in this course.

**Mandatory Attendance for Graded Activities**: You must be present in class to complete:

- In-class labs (6 total, with lowest score dropped)
- In-class interpretive essays (2 total)
- In-class Historiography Paper
- In-class Primary Document Analysis
- Final Interpretive Essay (during finals week)

**Note**: One-on-one meetings with the instructor are scheduled outside of class time during office hours or at mutually convenient times, and can be conducted in-person or via Zoom.

**Note for Students with Accommodations**: Students with extra-time accommodations will complete their written assignments (interpretive essays, historiography paper, primary document analysis, and final essay) at the University Testing Center rather than in the regular classroom.

Missing these sessions will result in a zero for that particular assignment, as there are no makeup opportunities for in-class activities unless the absence is documented with a doctor's note. In these rare cases, students will complete the assignment at the University Testing Center. The course is designed around active engagement with primary sources, discussions of complex historical interpretations, and collaborative learning that cannot be replicated outside the classroom environment.
